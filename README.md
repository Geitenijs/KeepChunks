# KeepRails
## An minor extension to the KeepChunks plugin, found at:
[SpigotMC Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/23307/)

KeepChunks allows you to select chunks to keep them loaded in the Minecraft server memory, even when there are no players around. This can be useful for large redstone circuits, minecart railroads, commandblock systems and even for reducing teleport lag.
